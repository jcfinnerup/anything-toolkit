## Tools i use or think of using in the future

Generally this is a list of tools and platforms that can help in creating a new project, a form of "indie hacker toolbox". 
You can easily build a whole product on pre-exsisting SaaS if money isn't an obstacle, but for side projects and indie-hackers, it usually is.
When trying out new ideas it's important that tools are free (or at least cheap), either initially or perhaps forever in a limited pricing tier. 
These use to live in a notepad somewhere, but now they're here in the hope that they might also help someone else. Feel free to add to this list in a PR
