## Tools i use or think of using in the future

Generally this is a list of tools and platforms that can help in creating a new project, a form of "indie hacker toolbox". 
You can easily build a whole product on pre-exsisting SaaS if money isn't an obstacle, but for side projects and indie-hackers, it usually is.
When trying out new ideas it's important that tools are free (or at least cheap), either initially or perhaps forever in a limited pricing tier. 
These used to live in a notepad somewhere, but now they're here in the hope that they might also help someone else. Feel free to add to this list in a PR

#### Feedback
- https://www.kampsite.co/ - Feature Suggestions from customers with a free tier available 

#### Hosting
- https://vercel.com (formerly zeit) - Really great but slightly vague pricing model, you can navigate their pricing and stay on the free tier for quite a while. Great for hosting static sites, serverless functions etc. Lighthouse score performs better than netlify
- https://netlify.com - Great for static projects, forms, serverless functions etc. In my opinion it has a better UX than vercel, but lighthouse performance score is lower on netlify than vercel. I'm not sure if that impacts SEO, but it might.

#### CMS
- https://prismic.io/ - Really nice and simply headless cms with free pricing options
#### Legal
- https://metomic.io/ - Great tool for handling cookie consent. It's a bit fiddly trying to rescan your website when you add a new script, but other than that it's nice
